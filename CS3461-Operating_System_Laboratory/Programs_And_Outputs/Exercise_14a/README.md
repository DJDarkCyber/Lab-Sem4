# Implementation Of FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm

`$ cc fcfs_disk_scheduling.c -o fcfs_disk_scheduling`

`$ ./fcfs_disk_scheduling`

OUTPUT:

```
Enter the max range of the disk: 2
Enter the size of the request queue: 1
Enter the queue of disk positions to be read: 2
Enter the initial head position: 3
Disk head moves from 3 to 2 with seek 1
Total Seek Time is 1
Average Seek Time is 1.000000
